# Feature: Reverse SSH tunnel device-to-cloud

This is the implementation of an edge-feature which will open-up a device to cloud ssh-connection, by which a developer or power-user can connect directly to the device (reverse-ssh tunnel).

In order to work this container must run in priviledged mode.
